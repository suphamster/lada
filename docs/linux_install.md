## Developer Installation (Linux)
This section describes how to install the app (CLI and GUI) from source.

> [!NOTE]
> This is the Linux guide. If you're on Windows (and don't want to use WSL) follow the [Windows Installation](windows_install.md).
> Native packages for Flatpack and Docker are described in the [README](../README.md#installation)

### Install CLI

1) Get the code
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ladaapp/lada.git
   cd lada
   ```

2) Install system dependencies with your system package manager or compile/install from source
   * Python >= 3.12, <= 3.13
   * FFmpeg >= 4.4

> [!TIP]
> Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -Syu python ffmpeg`
> 
> Ubuntu 25.04: `sudo apt install python3.13 python3.13-venv ffmpeg` 
> 
> Ubuntu 24.04: `sudo apt install python3.12 python3.12-venv ffmpeg`

3) Create a virtual environment to install python dependencies
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

4) [Install PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally)

> [!TIP]
> Before continuing check if the PyTorch installation was successful by checking if your GPU is detected (Skip this step if you're running on CPU)
> ```bash
> python -c "import torch ; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"`
> ```
> If this prints *True* then you're good. It will display *False* if the GPU is not available to PyTorch. Check your GPU drivers and that you chose the correct PyTorch Installation method for your hardware.

5) Install python dependencies
    ```bash
    python -m pip install -e '.[basicvsrpp]'
    ````

6) Apply patches
   
   On low-end hardware running mosaic detection model could run into a timeout defined in ultralytics library and the scene would not be restored. The following patch increases this time limit:
    ```bash
    patch -u .venv/lib/python3.1[23]/site-packages/ultralytics/utils/nms.py patches/increase_mms_time_limit.patch
    ```
   
   Disable crash-reporting / telemetry of one of our dependencies (ultralytics):
   ```bash
   patch -u .venv/lib/python3.1[23]/site-packages/ultralytics/utils/__init__.py  patches/remove_ultralytics_telemetry.patch
   ```
   
   Compatibility fix for using mmengine (restoration model dependency) with latest PyTorch:
   ```bash
   patch -u .venv/lib/python3.1[23]/site-packages/mmengine/runner/checkpoint.py  patches/fix_loading_mmengine_weights_on_torch26_and_higher.diff
   ```

7) Download model weights
   
   Download the models from the GitHub Releases page into the `model_weights` directory. The following commands do just that
   ```shell
   wget -P model_weights/ 'https://github.com/ladaapp/lada/releases/download/v0.7.1/lada_mosaic_detection_model_v3.1_accurate.pt'
   wget -P model_weights/ 'https://github.com/ladaapp/lada/releases/download/v0.7.1/lada_mosaic_detection_model_v3.1_fast.pt'
   wget -P model_weights/ 'https://github.com/ladaapp/lada/releases/download/v0.2.0/lada_mosaic_detection_model_v2.pt'
   wget -P model_weights/ 'https://github.com/ladaapp/lada/releases/download/v0.6.0/lada_mosaic_restoration_model_generic_v1.2.pth'
   ```

   If you're interested in running DeepMosaics' restoration model you can also download their pretrained model `clean_youknow_video.pth`
   ```shell
   wget -O model_weights/3rd_party/clean_youknow_video.pth 'https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1ulct4RhRxQp1v5xwEmUH7xz7AK42Oqlw&export=download&confirm=t'
   ```

Now you should be able to run the CLI by calling `lada-cli`.

### Install GUI

1) Install everything mentioned in [Install CLI](#install-cli)

2) Install system dependencies with your system package manager or compile/install from source
   * Gstreamer >= 1.14
   * PyGObject
   * GTK >= 4.0
   * libadwaita >= 1.6 [there is a workaround mentioned below to make it work with older versions]

> [!TIP]
> Arch Linux: 
> ```bash
> sudo pacman -Syu python-gobject gtk4 libadwaita gstreamer gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-bad gst-plugins-ugly gst-plugins-base-libs gst-plugins-bad-libs gst-plugin-gtk4
> ```
>   
> Ubuntu 25.04:
> ```bash
> sudo apt install gcc python3-dev pkg-config libgirepository-2.0-dev libcairo2-dev libadwaita-1-dev gir1.2-gstreamer-1.0
> sudo apt install libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio gstreamer1.0-alsa gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-gtk4
> ```
> 
> Ubuntu 24.04:
> ```bash
> sudo apt install gcc python3-dev pkg-config libgirepository-2.0-dev libcairo2-dev libadwaita-1-dev gir1.2-gstreamer-1.0
> sudo apt install libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio gstreamer1.0-alsa gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer1.0-libav
> #
> ####### Gstreamer #######
> # The gstreamer plugin gtk4 is not available as a binary package in Ubuntu 24.04 so we have to build it ourselves:
> # Get the source code
> git clone https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-plugins-rs.git
> cd gst-plugins-rs
> # Install dependencies necessary to build the plugin
> sudo apt  install rustup libssl-dev
> rustup default stable
> cargo install cargo-c
> # Now we can build and install the plugin. Note that we're installing to the system directory, you might want to adjust this to another directory and set set the environment variable GST_PLUGIN_PATH accordingly
> cargo cbuild -p gst-plugin-gtk4 --libdir /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
> sudo -E cargo cinstall -p gst-plugin-gtk4 --libdir /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
> # If the following command does not return an error the plugin is correctly installed
> gst-inspect-1.0 gtk4paintablesink
> #
> ####### libadwaita #######
> # The version of libadwaita in Ubuntu 24.04 repositories is too old. Instead of building the new version the following patch will adjust the code so it's compatible with the version provided by Ubuntu 24.04:
> patch -u -p1 -i patches/adw_spinner_to_gtk_spinner.patch
> > ```

3) Install python dependencies
    ```bash
    python -m pip install -e '.[gui]'
    ````

> [!TIP]
> If you intend to hack on the GUI code install also `gui-dev` extra: `python -m pip install -e '.[gui-dev]'`

Now you should be able to run the GUI by calling `lada`.

### Install Translations (optional)

If we have a translation file for your language you might want to use Lada in your preferred language instead of English.

1) Install system dependencies

> [!TIP]
> Arch Linux: 
> ```bash
> sudo pacman -Syu gettext 
> ```
>   
> Ubuntu:
> ```bash
> sudo apt install gettext
> ```

2) Compile translations
    ```bash
    bash translations/compile_po.sh
    ```

The app should now use the translations and be shown in your system language. If not then you may need to set the environment variable
`LANG` (or `LANGAUGE`) to your preferred language e.g. `export LANGUAGE="zh_TW"`.
